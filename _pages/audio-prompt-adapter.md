Hello! Iâ€™m Fang-Duo Tsai, a master's student at the Music and AI Lab at National Taiwan University, under the guidance of the esteemed [Prof. Yi-Hsuan Yang](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?id=1090726). I am currently working on Controllable Music Generation, with mentorship from [Shih-Lun Wu](https://slseanwu.github.io/). We have recently published our work on the [Audio Prompt Adapter](https://young-almond-689.notion.site/Audio-Prompt-Adapter-fbbfeb0608664f61a6bf894d56e85820) in ISMIR 2025.
